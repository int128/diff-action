# diff-action [![ts](https://github.com/int128/diff-action/actions/workflows/ts.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/int128/diff-action/actions/workflows/ts.yaml)

This is an action to compute a diff between head and base, and post it to a comment.


## Getting Started

To compute the diff between `old-directory` and `new-directory`:

```yaml
      - uses: int128/diff-action@v1
        with:
          base: old-directory
          head: new-directory
```

### Show diff of generated manifests

If you use `kustomize build` in your CI/CD pipeline, it would be useful if you can see the diff on a pull request.

To build manifests with [int128/kustomize-action](https://github.com/int128/kustomize-action) and show diff of it:

```yaml
jobs:
  diff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: main
          path: main
      - uses: int128/kustomize-action@v1
        id: kustomize-head
        with:
          kustomization: config/default/kustomization.yaml
          write-individual-files: true
      - uses: int128/kustomize-action@v1
        id: kustomize-base
        with:
          base-directory: main
          kustomization: config/default/kustomization.yaml
          write-individual-files: true
      - uses: int128/diff-action@v1
        with:
          base: ${{ steps.kustomize-base.outputs.directory }}
          head: ${{ steps.kustomize-head.outputs.directory }}
```

        with:
