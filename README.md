# diff-action [![ts](https://github.com/int128/diff-action/actions/workflows/ts.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/int128/diff-action/actions/workflows/ts.yaml)

This is an action to compute a diff between head and base, and post it to a comment.

## Getting Started

To post a comment of the diff between `old-directory` and `new-directory`,

```yaml
- uses: int128/diff-action@v1
  with:
    base: old-directory
    head: new-directory
```

If no difference, it post a comment of "No diff" by default.

### Show diff of generated manifests

If you use `kustomize build` in your CI/CD pipeline, it would be useful if you can see the diff on a pull request.

To build manifests with [int128/kustomize-action](https://github.com/int128/kustomize-action) and show diff of it:

```yaml
jobs:
  diff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write # required to post a comment to a pull request
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: main
          path: main
      - uses: int128/kustomize-action@v1
        id: kustomize-head
        with:
          kustomization: config/default/kustomization.yaml
          write-individual-files: true
      - uses: int128/kustomize-action@v1
        id: kustomize-base
        with:
          base-directory: main
          kustomization: config/default/kustomization.yaml
          write-individual-files: true
      - uses: int128/diff-action@v1
        with:
          base: ${{ steps.kustomize-base.outputs.directory }}
          head: ${{ steps.kustomize-head.outputs.directory }}
```

Here is an example.

### Label to indicate the change

To add label(s) if there is difference or remove it if not:

```yaml
- uses: int128/diff-action@v1
  with:
    base: ${{ steps.kustomize-base.outputs.directory }}
    head: ${{ steps.kustomize-head.outputs.directory }}
    label: manifest-changed
```

### No diff comment

To change the comment of when no difference,

```yaml
- uses: int128/diff-action@v1
  with:
    comment-body-no-diff: No diff of kustomize build
```

To suppress any comment when no difference,

```yaml
- uses: int128/diff-action@v1
  with:
    comment-body-no-diff: ''
```

### Comment strategy

This action supports the following strategies:

- `create`: Create a new comment.
- `replace`: Replace the body of existing comment if exists. (default)
- `append`: Append the diff to the existing comment if exists.
- `recreate`: Delete the existing comment and create a new one.

You can change the strategy by `update-if-exists`.

This action identifies the existing comment by both workflow name and job name.
You can set a custom key to `update-if-exists-key`.

## Specification

This action posts a comment on `pull_request` or `pull_request_target` event only.
